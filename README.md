# hello-world
World, to thee I say, "Hello."

Once again, I enter a new world of thing-doery, such that I can do things that benefit other things.
Human things.
Human things what might help other, better things.
Things like cat things.  And dog things.
Galapagos tortoise things.
All the things.
But mostly, really, just dropping code about, patching wee bits of other-code when plausible, and perhaps, one day, graduating up from Code Monklet to full-blown Code Monkey.  I think Code Minkey is somewhere between those.  Not really sure on that.
